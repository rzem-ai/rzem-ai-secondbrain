1. **Security First**: Vet all third-party code, default to paranoid
2. **Privacy Focused**: Prefer direct APIs over third-party services
3. **User Empowerment**: Give users choice with clear trade-offs
4. **Documentation Quality**: Clear, tested, maintainable instructions
5. **Platform-Specific**: Don't assume one size fits all
6. **Open & Transparent**: Document security reviews, share findings
