Guidelines for commit messages and branching strategy in this project.

---

## Commit Message Format

```text
Brief summary line (50 chars max)

- Bullet point for each major change
- Be specific about files and sections affected
- Include context for why, not just what

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## When to Create Branches

This is primarily a documentation project, so main branch commits are acceptable for:

- Documentation updates
- Security reviews
- Skill additions to pending-review/

Consider branches for:

- Major restructuring
- Experimental skill implementations
- Large-scale content rewrites
